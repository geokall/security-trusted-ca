# SSL chain of trust - Certificate validation

## Theory
The main reason https is implemented is, because in http every information is exchanged in clear text, which makes it vulnerable. <br />
This is not a problem if the webpage does not share any useful information like credit cards.
In case a webpage, shares useful information, https is been used.

## HTTPS
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.[2][3]
In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP over TLS,[4] or HTTP over SSL.
The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website, and protection of the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and server protects the communications against eavesdropping and tampering.[5][6] The authentication aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server-side digital certificates.

## TLS
Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypts data sent over the Internet to ensure that eavesdroppers and hackers are unable
to see what you transmit which is particularly useful for private and sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, <br/ >
and personal correspondence.
TLS is normally implemented on top of TCP in order to encrypt Application Layer protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP and IMAP, <br />
although it can also be implemented on UDP, DHCP and SCTP as well (e.g. for VPN and SIP-based application uses).

## CA
A Certificate Authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certificates conforming to the ITU-Tâ€™s X.509 standard <br />
for Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs). Digital certificates certify the public key of the owner of the certificate <br />
(known as the subject), and that the owner controls the domain being secured by the certificate.

Based on [Root certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_certificate) in order to validate the certificate from an url <br />
we need to verify X509 Certificate chain of trust.

## Design - Implementation
The first step is to retrieve X509 instances (SSL chain of trust). To do that, an SSL context is initialized. In this context <br />
is loaded the ca-bundle.crt, using the ```certifi.where()``` method. <br />
```python
conn.get_peer_cert_chain()
```
Above function fetches the instances. The first element is the url's certificate and the last element the root ca. <br />
In the next step, an object with all the attributes is created and appended in a list. <br />
For the subject, keeping only the 'O'(organization) and for the issuer the 'CN' (common name). <br />
Another useful attribute is the 'hasExpired', which provides us the information if the certificate is expired.
<br />
The final step is to read the trusted CA. If the url's root CA does exist in the list of CA certificates, <br />
then the certificate is valid. <br />
Apart from that, the date where the certificate stops being valid is printed in the result output.
